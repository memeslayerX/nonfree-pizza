Inaba?

00:09.760 --> 00:10.720
What's wrong, Inaba?

00:11.430 --> 00:13.930
That website requires nonfree javascript, you idiot!

00:13.930 --> 00:16.900
Nonfree? But I didn't have to pay...

00:20.860 --> 00:22.110
Sorry!

00:22.110 --> 00:24.780
We could get pineapple instead of pepperoni

00:24.780 --> 00:25.860
if you want!

00:25.860 --> 00:27.320
So stop crying!

00:28.070 --> 00:30.490
Inaba, I have an app for it.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.620
Okay? We'll use the app instead.

00:32.990 --> 00:35.330
What, that's not okay either?

00:35.330 --> 00:37.120
Uhm, we can call them.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.630
We can call them, Inaba-chan.

00:39.630 --> 00:42.130
I finally made it back.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.260
Iori, how was the Windows Club's party?

00:44.260 --> 00:47.510
It looked like they were having fun.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.510
Wait, where's our pizza?

00:49.510 --> 00:52.310
We haven't decided how to order yet.

00:52.310 --> 00:55.140
Inaba, I could drive down and order in person!

00:55.140 --> 00:56.060
Would that be okay?

00:56.060 --> 00:59.190
Inaba, how do you want us to order?

00:59.190 --> 01:01.690
I'm getting hungry, Inaba-chan.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.150
Inaban? Inaban?

01:03.150 --> 01:03.820
What's wrong?

01:03.820 --> 01:08.500
